# Agent Memory (Auto-Synced)

This file is the centralized, version-controlled view of agent memory.

- Source of truth: the individual files under `/memories` (managed by the agent-memory extension).
- Sync: when `agentMemory.autoSyncToFile` is configured, the extension automatically updates this file.

(Generated/updated by tooling — manual edits may be overwritten.)
