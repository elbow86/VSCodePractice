# Refactoring Prompts

## Code Cleanup

```
Refactor this code to improve readability and maintainability:

```[language]
[Paste code to refactor]
```

**Focus Areas:**
- [ ] Extract reusable functions
- [ ] Improve variable names
- [ ] Reduce complexity
- [ ] Add type safety
- [ ] Remove code duplication
- [ ] Follow [SPECIFIC_PATTERN] pattern

**Constraints:**
- Maintain existing functionality
- Don't break existing APIs
- [Any other constraints]

**Style guide:** [Link to or describe style preferences]
```

## Architecture Improvement

```
Improve the architecture of [MODULE/SYSTEM].

**Current Issues:**
- [Issue 1: e.g., tight coupling]
- [Issue 2: e.g., performance bottleneck]
- [Issue 3: e.g., difficult to test]

**Current Structure:**
[Brief description or file listing]

**Goals:**
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved testability
- Enhanced performance
- Easier maintenance

**Constraints:**
- [Migration considerations]
- [Backward compatibility requirements]
- [Resource limitations]

Please provide:
1. Proposed new architecture
2. Migration plan
3. Benefits and trade-offs
```

## Performance Optimization

```
Optimize this code for better performance:

```[language]
[Code that needs optimization]
```

**Performance Goals:**
- Target: [e.g., reduce execution time by 50%]
- Metrics: [e.g., response time, memory usage]
- Load: [expected usage patterns]

**Current Bottlenecks:**
[Include profiling data if available]

**Optimization Areas:**
- [ ] Algorithm efficiency
- [ ] Memory usage
- [ ] Database queries
- [ ] Network requests
- [ ] Caching
- [ ] Lazy loading

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain current functionality
- [Any other technical constraints]
```

## Design Pattern Implementation

```
Refactor this code to implement the [PATTERN_NAME] pattern:

```[language]
[Current code]
```

**Reasons for this pattern:**
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Problem it solves]

**Requirements:**
- Follow standard implementation of [PATTERN_NAME]
- Maintain existing public API
- Add appropriate abstractions
- Include usage examples

**Reference implementation:** [If you have examples to follow]
