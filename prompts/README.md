# Prompts Collection

This folder contains reusable AI prompt templates and examples for various development tasks.

## Folder Structure

- **`coding/`** - Code generation, implementation, and feature development prompts
- **`documentation/`** - Documentation writing, README generation, and API docs
- **`debugging/`** - Troubleshooting, error analysis, and bug fixing prompts
- **`refactoring/`** - Code improvement, optimization, and restructuring prompts

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Copy and customize** - Use these as starting points, adapt to your specific needs
2. **Add context** - Include relevant code snippets, error messages, or project details
3. **Be specific** - The more context you provide, the better the AI response
4. **Iterate** - Refine prompts based on results and add successful patterns back

## Best Practices

- Include file paths and line numbers when referencing code
- Provide error messages in full when debugging
- Specify the programming language and framework being used
- Include relevant dependencies and versions when applicable
- Add expected output format or structure requirements
