# Chronology 
First I made a VSCodePractice repo/workspace
Then I
1. tried Agent mode to create a State Design pattern example cause I always thought that was a cool design pattern
2. then I made an unrelated 'msdocs-assistant' re-usable prompt file..  must have seen it in a Youtube video..
3. then I ran it and it made all the files of my 2nd commit.
